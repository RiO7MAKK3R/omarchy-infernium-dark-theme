# Infernium-Dark Theme

A dark, high-contrast theme inspired by molten lava, biomechanical aesthetics, and modern development workflows. Dark greys serve as a solid base while fiery oranges and deep lava tones provide energy and focus, creating a visually striking and cohesive environment for coding, system monitoring, and productivity.
